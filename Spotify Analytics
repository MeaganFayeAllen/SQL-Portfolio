# First I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Second I created a tavle to insert Spotify data into and 
  then finally performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#After creating the table, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table

#The following section is my exploration of the data using SQL

/* Find the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track */

SELECT artist_name,track_name ,avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

/* Find the artist with the highest energy */

SELECT artist_name,track_name,
MAX(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name,track_name
ORDER BY MAX(ENERGY) desc
LIMIT 1

/* Find the Top 10 artists by popularity */

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

/* Calculate the average popularity for the artistis, then for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, popularity
  and label them as a 'Top Star' */
